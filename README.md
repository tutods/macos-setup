# **macOS** Setup

## üìÑ Info

This repository contains a bundle of **Python** and **Shell** files/scripts to handle my **macOS** setup.

### ‚ûï What is included?

The setup allows you to choose what you want to execute, including:

- Install [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/)
- Install and setup shell using **Fish** and **Oh-my-fish**;
- Install **Node.js** <small>(using [**asdf**](https://asdf-vm.com/))</small>;
- Install and setup **Visual Studio Code** <small>(including extensions)</small>;
- Install and setup **Hyper** terminal;

Inside each option, some of them allow you to choose sub-steps to run.
For example, if you select the **Shell** option, will appear three sub-steps:

- Install;
- Copy configuration(s);
- Install and add **Oh-my-fish** configuration.

### ‚ûñ What's not included?

All the applications I have from **App Store**, like **Paste Now** and others, will not be installed. Basically, this is
only for the things that are possible to run via terminal.
