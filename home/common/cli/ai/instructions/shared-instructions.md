## Fast CLI Tool Preferences

Always prefer these tools over slower alternatives:

| Use | Instead of | Why |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| `rg` | `grep` | 10x faster content search |
| `fd` | `find` | 10x faster file finding |
| `fzf` | Manual selection | Fuzzy finder for interactive search, multi-select, and filtering |
| `bat --style=plain` | `cat` | Syntax highlighting, Git integration |
| `jq` | Manual JSON parsing | Native fast JSON processing |
| `yq` | Manual YAML parsing | Native fast YAML processing |
| `rtk` | Raw commands | Token proxy, reduces LLM token usage by 60-90% |
| `eza` | `ls` | Icons, Git status, tree view |
| `delta` | `diff` | Better diff rendering |
| `htop` | `top` | Interactive process viewer |
| `pnpm` | `npm`/`yarn` | Faster, disk-efficient, strict dependency resolution |
| `biome` | `eslint`+`prettier` | Unified lint+format, 10x faster than eslint |

## General Workflow

- Use `rg` for searching file contents, `fd` for finding files by name
- Use `ast-grep` (sg) for structural code search and precise matching
- Use `fzf` for interactive selection, search, and filtering
- Use `bat` for reading files when syntax highlighting helps
- Use `rtk` for git operations and command execution when available
- **Package Manager Enforcement**: 
  - Always check for lock files in the current or parent directory to determine the package manager.
  - If `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists $\rightarrow$ use `pnpm`.
  - If `yarn.lock` exists $\rightarrow$ use `yarn`.
  - If `package-lock.json` exists $\rightarrow$ use `npm`.
  - Do not mix package managers in a project.
- Prefer Nix-managed tools over ad-hoc installs
- When editing files, prefer the Edit tool over Bash with sed/awk
- Always run type checks (`pnpm typecheck` or `tsc --noEmit`) before declaring a task complete
- Prefer targeted edits over rewriting entire files
- Use type-safe patterns — avoid `any`, prefer branded types and Zod schemas for runtime validation

## Git & Commits

- Commit messages: imperative mood, present tense (`feat: add X`, `fix: broken Y`)
- Prefer small, focused commits over large batches
- Never commit secrets, `.env` files, or credentials
- Branch names: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/` prefixes

## Security & AI Safety

- **Secrets**: Never log output from `doppler` secrets or print plaintext credentials in AI-assisted logs.
- **Verification**: Always verify AI-generated networking or security commands before executing with `sudo`.

## AI Tool Selection

- `claude-code` — default for all coding tasks; full context, skills, MCP servers
- `opencode` — multi-provider or when you need a different model mid-session
- `codex` — isolated throwaway scripts, one-shot shell tasks
- `ollama` — offline/private work (no network, no logs)
- `repomix` — pack repo context before switching tools or sharing with non-Claude AI
- `ccusage` — token usage dashboard (`npx ccusage@latest` or `ccusage` abbreviation)

## Nix Dotfiles (this repo)

- Repo root: `~/.dotfiles` — all commands run from there
- Deploy: `./nix.sh macbook` or `./nix.sh work`
- Build only (no sudo): `./nix.sh macbook --build-only`
- Module hierarchy: `modules/` (all hosts) → `hosts/darwin/<name>/` (per machine) → `home/common/` (all users) → `home/roles/<role>/` (personal/work)
- Homebrew casks: shared in `modules/darwin/homebrew/casks/`, machine-specific in `hosts/darwin/<name>/homebrew/`
- Adding packages: system packages in `modules/packages/`, user packages via `home/common/` or host-specific
- Prefer `pkgsUnstable` only for tools that need latest (claude-code, codex, opencode); use stable for everything else
